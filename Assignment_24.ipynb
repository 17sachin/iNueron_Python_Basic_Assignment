The downside is that they can cause infinite loops and other unexpected results if not written properly. For example, in the example above, the function is terminated if the number is 0 or less or greater than 9. If proper cases are not included in a recursive function to stop the execution, it will repeat forever, causing the program to crash or become unresponsive."
